title=Tiled map
description=Create a rendered pyramid from a given map. The aim is to provide a pre-computed tiled map with various level of details, for an efficient display.
input.mapcontext=Map to paint in output tile cache. Note that if this parameter is set, you should NOT set dataset parameter.
input.dataset=Dataset to use as source for the map to paint in tile cache. The rendering is configured for each data of the selected dataset by taking first associated style. If no style is provided for a data, we'll use Examind default rendering rules. If set, the map-context parameter should NOT be set.
input.crs=Coordinate reference system to use for rendering.
input.envelope=Area of interest to tile map on. This allows to query tiling only on a part of source map. If not set, source map is entirely tiled.
input.service=WMS service to publish tiled map upon.
input.create-data=If set, the created pyramid will be inserted into Examind as a new data, named according to the given text. If neither this parameter nor update parameter is set, the map have to be published on a WMS service.
input.update-data=If set, we'll paint map in the specified tiled data instead of create a new one.
input.tile-size=The size to use for output tiles, in pixels. Created tiles will be square tiles.
input.tile-levels=Number of level of details to generate. If not set, we'll try to determine an appropriate number of levels by analyzing input data resolutions. Note : Level of details determine a quad-tree in which level 0 is a single tile over the entire map.
input.axes-convention=Related to target coordinate reference system (crs input). This allow to force an orientation on chosen coordinate system. For example, if a lat/long system is chosen, it is possible to inverse its axes (getting a long/lat system) by specifying the appropriate axis convention. By default, a right-handed convention is applied, meaning that any generated pyramid will be a long/lat pyramid.
