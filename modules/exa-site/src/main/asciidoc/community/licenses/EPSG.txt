                            EPSG dataset terms of use
                             Revised 6 November 2014
                         http://www.epsg.org/TermsOfUse



1. In this document the following definitions of terms apply:

    * “Registry” means the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Registry;

    * “EPSG Dataset” means EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset;

    * “IOGP” means the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers,
      incorporated in England as a company limited by guarantee (number 1832064);

    * “EPSG Facilities” means the Registry, the EPSG Dataset (published through the Registry
      or through a downloadable MS-Access file or through a set of SQL scripts that enable a
      user to create an Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL or other database and populate that database
      with the EPSG Dataset) and associated documentation consisting of the Release Notes and
      Guidance Notes 7.1 and 7.2

    * “the data” means the geodetic parameter data and associated metadata, contained in the
      EPSG Dataset; it also refers to any subset of data from the EPSG Dataset.


2. The EPSG Facilities are published by IOGP at no charge. Distribution for profit is forbidden.

3. The EPSG Facilities are owned by IOGP. They are compiled by the Geodetic Subcommittee of the
   IOGP from publicly available and member-supplied information.

4. In order to use the EPSG Facilities, you must agree to these Terms of Use. You may not use
   the EPSG Facilities or any of them in whole or in part unless you agree to these Terms of Use.

5. You can accept these Terms of Use by clicking the command button ‘Accept Terms’ upon registering
   as a new user. You will also be required to accept any revised Terms of Use prior to using or
   downloading any EPSG Facilities. You understand and agree that any use of the EPSG Facilities
   or any of them, even if obtained without clicking acceptance, will be acceptance of these Terms
   of Use.

6. The data may be used, copied and distributed subject to the following conditions:

    i.   Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information contained
         in the EPSG Facilities, neither the IOGP nor any of its members past present or future
         warrants their accuracy or will, regardless of its or their negligence, assume liability
         for any foreseeable or unforeseeable use made thereof, which liability is hereby excluded.
         Consequently, such use is at your own risk. You are obliged to inform anyone to whom you
         provide the EPSG Facilities of these Terms of Use.

    ii.  DATA AND INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE EPSG FACILITIES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
         OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED
         WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND/OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

    iii. The data may be included in any commercial package provided that any commerciality is
         based on value added by the provider and not on a value ascribed to the EPSG Dataset
         which is made available at no charge.

    iv.  Ownership of the EPSG Dataset by IOGP must be acknowledged in any publication or
         transmission (by whatever means) thereof (including permitted modifications).

    v.   Subsets of information may be extracted from the dataset. Users are advised that
         coordinate reference system and coordinate transformation descriptions are incomplete
         unless all elements detailed as essential in IOGP Surveying and Positioning Guidance
         Note 7-1 annex F are included.

    vi.  Essential elements should preferably be reproduced as described in the dataset.
         Modification of parameter values is permitted as described in the table 1 to allow
         change to the content of the information provided that numeric equivalence is achieved.
         Numeric equivalence refers to the results of geodetic calculations in which the
         parameters are used, for example (i) conversion of ellipsoid defining parameters,
         or (ii) conversion of parameters between one and two standard parallel projection methods,
         or (iii) conversion of parameters between 7-parameter geocentric transformation methods.

    vii. No data that has been modified other than as permitted in these Terms of Use shall be
         attributed to the EPSG Dataset.
