  # Mainly check project sanity by installing all components and running unit tests.
  # It also serve as main job for cache update.
  #
  # For now, disable it for sis-migration because:
  # 1. We would need to build GeoAPI / SIS beforehand
  # 2. We have to be careful with maven local repository caching, that would be polluted with GeoAPI and SIS snapshots
  # 3. Anyway, dependence upon unstable libraries is a bad idea. If not avoidable, we should use submodules to ease the maintainance
